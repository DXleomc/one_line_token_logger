## I am not responsible for anything that happens by using this token logger.

A basic discord token logger that cycles through user cookies until it finds a discord cookie, and then will send that cookie to discord webhook.
Using python and base64, you can shorten this token logger into a single line that can implanted into any application.

The reason I don't provide the shortened logger already generated is because the webhook link wouldn't be editable

Usage:
 1. Open up token_logger.py and then change the webhook link on line 19 to your own.
 2. Use one_line_generator.py to generate the one line version
 3. Profit
